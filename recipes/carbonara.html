    <h1>Carbonara Receipe</h1>
    This is a real spaghetti carbonara recipe made the traditional Italian way, without a single drop of cream. It relies solely on egg and cheese to make a luscious, creamy carbonara sauce. Food fit for a king (or queen!) that proves simple can be magnificent
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>175g pancetta</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>100g parmigiano reggiano</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>400g spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cooking salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pasta cooking water</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>parsley, <em>for garnish</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Pancetta</strong> - Cut into 0.5cm / 1/5" thick slices then into batons</li>
    <li><strong>Carbonara sauce</strong>- Place eggs and yolks in a large bowl. Whisk to combine. Then stir in the parmesan and pepper</li>
    <li><strong>Cook pasta</strong>- Bring 4 litres (4 quarts) of water to the boil with the salt. Add pasta and cook per the packet directions</li>
    <li><strong>Reserve pasta water</strong>- Just before draining, scoop out 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta</li>
    <li><strong>Cook pancetta</strong>- While the pasta is cooking, place pancetta in a non stick pan over medium high heat. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until golden. No oil needed â€“ as the guanciale heats up, the fat will melt so it fries in its own fat. If using garlic, add it in the last minute</li>
    <li><strong>Pasta in pan</strong>- Tip the hot pasta into the pan and toss to coat in pancetta fat</li>
    <li><strong>Mix pasta in sauce</strong>- Transfer the pasta and any residual fat in the pan into the bowl with the egg. Add 1/2 cup (125 ml) pasta cooking water. Stir vigorously using the handle of a wooden spoon for 1 minute and watch as the sauce transforms from watery to creamy and clings to the pasta strands</li>
    <li><strong>Serve</strong>- Transfer into warm bowls. Serve immediately, garnished with a little extra parmigiana reggiano if desired, and a pinch of black pepper and finely chopped parsley</li>
