    <h1>Beef Fried Rice Recipe of the Gods</h1>
    <p>Have you ever thought to make fried rice with beef mince? It works beautifully! Fry up ground beef in an intense
        savoury sauce until it’s beautifully caramelised, then toss it through rice with fluffy bits of scrambled egg
        and vegetables of choice.
    <p>
        So quick to make – no chopping raw meat! And in my version, I’ve opted for even more convenience by making this
        with frozen diced veg. Because I totally buy into the whole snap-frozen thing.
    </p>
    But if you’re a better person than me, please do not let me stop you from chopping up fresh vegetables. Also,
    excellent fridge clean-out opportunity!

        <li>250g beef mince</li>

        <li>3 cups day old cooked rice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely sliced green onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix sauce</strong> ingredients in a small bowl, set aside</li>
        <li><strong>Scramble eggs</strong> - Heat sesame oil in a large wok or non-stick pan over medium high heat. Add
            egg and cook, stirring gently, so it is softly scrambled. Remove onto a plate </li>
        <li><strong>Cook Beef</strong> - Heat vegetable oil in the same pan over high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook
            for 30 seconds. Add beef and cook, breaking it up as you go, for 2 minutes or until you no longer see raw
            beef. Add 2 tablespoons of sauce and cook for 1 minute </li>
        <li><strong>Cook Veg, Caramalise beef</strong> - Add frozen vegetables and cook for 2 minutes or until the beef
            gets nicely caramelised – this is the trick to great flavour so do not shortcut this</li>
        <li><strong>Rice and sauce</strong> - Add rice and remaining sauce. Toss for 2 minutes until the sauce is well
            dispersed throughout the rice and the rice grains start to caramelise a bit</li>
        <li><strong>Egg and green onion</strong> - Then add scrambled eggs and green onion, give it a quick toss to
            disperse then divide between bowls. EAT</li>
    </ol>
