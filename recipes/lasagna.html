    </ul>
    <h4>Lasagne Assembly</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>10 Lasagne sheets</li>
        <li>75g Parmigiano Reggiano or Pecorino</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4>Ragu</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In heavy-bottomed saucepan or Dutch oven, add the pancetta and cook until crispy. Remove from the pan and
            set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the olive oil and butter to the fat over medium heat. Add the onion, celery and carrot and sweat down
            until the vegetables are translucent</li>
        <li>In the meantime, combine the two portions of mince together in a large bowl. Add a little olive oil and,
            using your very clean hands, combine the mince.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic to the vegetables and stir for one minute to combine. Do not let the garlic burn or it will
            make the finished ragù bitter.</li>
        <li>Add the pork and beef mix and stir into vegetables. Brown over medium-high heat, stirring.</li>
        <li>Once the ragù is browned, add the tomato paste and work into the ragù until the paste ad really deepened in
            colour. Add the pancetta back into the ragù.</li>
        <li>Add the milk and simmer while stirring until the milk is reduced, around 2-3 minutes</li>
        <li>Add the wine and stir until evaporated.</li>
        <li>Add the stock, bring to a boil and then lower the heat as low as you can go.</li>
        <li>Put the lid on the pot and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, stirring every 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid slightly and simmer for another 1 1/2 hours</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Besciamella</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine milk, onion, parsley stalks, peppercorns, bay leaves and cloves in a saucepan and simmer over medium
            heat. Remove from heat and set aside for 15 minutes to infuse</li>
        <li>Strain milk mixture through a fine sieve into a large measuring cup</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-high until foaming. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly for
            1-2 minutes or until mixture bubbles and begins to come away from side of pan. Remove from heat</li>
        <li>Pour in half the milk gradually, whisking with a balloon whisk until mixture is smooth. Gradually add the
            remaining milk, whisking until smooth and combined</li>
        <li>Place saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to the boil, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, for 5
            minutes or until sauce thickens and coats the back of the spoon. Remove from heat. Taste and season with
            nutmeg, salt and pepper</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Lasagne Assembly</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 220°C.</li>
        <li>Grease a lasagne pan with butter and spread a thin layer of ragu over the bottom. Spread a layer of
            besciamella over this and sprinkle with 15g of Parmigiano Reggiano</li>
        <li>Lay a layer of lasagne sheets on top of this. Break the corners of the sheets going into the corners so they
            are a snug fit. Try not to overlap the sheets</li>
        <li>Cover with a thin layer of ragu, then besciamella, being careful to make sure the ragu and besciamella cover
            the corners to help prevent burning. Sprinkle with 15g of Parmigiano Reggiano</li>
        <li>Repeat this process 4 times so you have 5 layers of lasagne sheets in total</li>
        <li>When it comes to the final pasta sheets, only put down a layer of besciamella and cheese</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven for 20-30 minutes and check for doneness, you want a golden cheesy layer on top and the
            sauce should be bubbling</li>
        <li>Let the lasagne rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing. If you do this sooner the lasagne layers will
            spread out over the plate</li>
    </ol>
